I've been looking into organization tools recently
and have begun picking up Obsidian link.
However, a mental block for me has been the movement
away from folder structures to tags.
I started organizing using folders for work, home,
tasks, projects, etc. but found this to be 
cumbersome and, after watching some tutorials link,
the wrong way to do it.

This video by the same author link talks touches on some of the differences,
but and I've still not yet been able to fully embrace
and utilize Obsidian.
I suspect there's something interesting to dig into here,
and, because a Tildes comment I recently stumbled upon
link
[https://tildes.net/~tildes/18io/can_we_get_an_ai#comment-9ry1]
mentions a similar switch. 

I'm kind of excited about this idea because of loose? strong?
connections to other ideas.
On one side, there are folders, groups, subgroups,
hierarchies, subsets,
and on the other side tags, connections,
links, equal or unspecified relationships.

A reason I have probably struggled with moving ideas from
mind to material may have something to do with this.
Typical methods for organization revolve around these
hierarchical schemes: I've always tried to use folder 
hierarchies, or class inheritance, or something similar.
They work in some cases, but I suspect that the ajidah
I feel around writing and organizing thoughts has a lot
to do with being annoyed when I have to ``re-organize":
something belongs in more than one folder, the hierarchy
needs to change, I have to bend what I want to say to make it
fit, etc.

From the math perspective I'm thinking about this
as the difference between directed and undirected graphs,
where directions represent hierarchies and dependencies,
and undirected connections represent any arbitrary relationship.

If this were meant to be a college essay, I might attempt
to draw parallels between societal organization, a la
capitalism and socialism. But for now I don't want to 
spend that energy, and leave that to the deadline-pressed
uni student reading this.
