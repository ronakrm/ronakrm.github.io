title: "Priorities Change"
excerpt: "The world is changing fast, and some things I used to care about are less important."

Our lives, humanity, intelligence, and life, are going
to drastically change in the near future at a most likely exponential rate.
Realizing and internalizing this 
is scary, but also somewhat motivating:
things I used to be concerned about are now
small issues.
For me, I feel more confident they will be solved,
but have moved lower in priority for me.

I think in some ways this is good for me,
if the world were to continue unfolding sans AGI.
I thought privacy was extremely important,
and was particularly concerned about
people around me, strangers,
and corporations knowing anything about me.
This combined and fueled 
issues around self-expression,
self-image, and fear of failure.
Though I've been doing better w.r.t.
these things generally absent of approaching singularity,
I would have liked to continue
boycotting social media,
learning about and using free and open-source
software alternatives, blocking trackers,
unnecessary javascript, etc.
I think it's too late,
and if I think I can have any impact
in ensuring alignment,
it's more important to connect
with people in positions to do so.

I'm going to brain dump more. I need to not
care as much if I use correct or incorrect lingo,
if my style matches or does not match existing norms 
in certain places, if someone I know or don't know
will agree or not with what I am saying.
It just needs to get out, because there
isn't much time left to get things out. (Perhaps an eventual
link here to a post about my timeline.)
