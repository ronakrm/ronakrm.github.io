I believe our lives, humanity, intelligence, and life, are going
to drastically change in the fairly near future at an exponential rate.
Realizing and internalizing this 
is scary, but also somewhat motivating and freeing:
things I used to be concerned about are now
smaller issues.
I still think they are important
and am excited and happy about
the people working on them,
but my priorities have changed.

I think in some ways this is good for me,
even if the world were to continue unfolding sans exponential change.
I thought privacy was extremely important,
and was particularly concerned about
people around me, strangers,
and corporations knowing anything about me.
This combined and fueled 
issues around self-expression,
self-image, and fear of failure.
Though I've been doing better w.r.t.
these things generally, absent of approaching singularity,
I would have liked to continue
boycotting social media,
learning about and using free and open-source
software alternatives, blocking trackers,
unnecessary javascript, etc.

For a number of reasons,
it's more important and productive for me to connect
take advantage of the tools and platforms
that make communicating, connecting,
and sharing easier, accepting that
my data is not mine anymore.

I'm going to try to brain dump more. I need to not
care as much if I use correct or incorrect lingo,
if my style matches or does not match existing norms 
in certain places, if someone I know or don't know
will agree or not with what I am saying.
It just needs to get out, and others can
judge if it's valuable to them.
I need to act on the trust I have that people
will be understanding and forgiving
if I make mistakes, and that I can
only learn and get better by doing.
